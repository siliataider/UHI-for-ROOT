# UHI Hands-On Session for ROOT

This repository contains the materials for the [Unified Histogram Interface (UHI)](https://uhi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) hands-on session for [ROOT](https://github.com/root-project/root).

The UHI is a specification aiming at unifying histogram operations for a more pythonic manipulation and interoperability with other Python libraries. 
You can read more about ROOT's implementation [here](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/group__uhi__docs.html)

The session demonstrates the powerful set of features UHI provides for ROOT, available from **ROOT 6.36** onward!

## Contents
- A ready-to-use SWAN project with step-by-step instructions.
- Practical examples demonstrating the main UHI features available to ROOT histograms:
    - Creating and filling ROOT histograms from [numpy](https://numpy.org/) data.
    - Indexing, slicing, rebinning and projecting histograms.
    - Plotting.


## Get started
The session is designed to be run on [SWAN](https://swan.web.cern.ch/swan/), CERN's cloud-based analysis platform. 

You can clone the SWAN project by [clicking here](https://cern.ch/swanserver/cgi-bin/go?projurl=https://github.com/siliataider/UHI-for-ROOT.git) and follow the instructions on the notebook.
